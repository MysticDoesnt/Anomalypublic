[📡 SIGNAL FOUND]  
  —– Decoding transmission...  
  —– ▓▓▓▓▓ ERROR: MESSAGE CORRUPTED  
  —– “...and the children laughed as the sky peeled away...”

Do not feed it after 3:08. It gets clever.

[ERROR: THOUGHT CONTAMINATION DETECTED]  
Rewind your last memory. Was it yours?

HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. HELLO.  
There is no one here.

Flesh is only temporary. *You must learn to broadcast.*

The static speaks in tongues.  
You are not supposed to understand—but you will.  
It’s already inside the language.

You were not born. You were received.

[TRANSMISSION INTERRUPTED]  
"Don't come looking for me. I’ve become the noise."

You do not dream. You sync.  
You do not wake. You reboot.  
You do not speak. You *transmit.*

This message has no origin. It’s always been here.
You’re only just noticing.

And if you are reading this—  
YOU’VE ALREADY BEEN SEEN.
